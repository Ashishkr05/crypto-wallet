# crypto-wallet
in this project- this is blockchain based technology ,we have made decentralized web application on etherium blockchain and smart contract
user can transfer etherium or withdraw etherium.

#METHODOLOGY

install Gnache and Metamerse 
Gnache-> is a personal etherium Blockchain used to test smart contract where you deploy contracts.

Metamerse-> it inject two thing web3 and etherium by which we connnect that with our blockchain, smart contract.


# CONCEPT USE
Blockchain-> it is a database which is decentralized basically no one has any authority,it is difficult to change.Blockchain is a block of information.

smart code-> it is used for transaction,for interact between smart contract and front-end we need API that work as a smart contract.

# Tools and technology use

Truffle-> truffle developed enviroment testing for etherium blockchain,it is used to deploy blockchain in gnache we connect react js to blockchain.

React js-> it is integerated with web 3-JS , it install to write code for funding , it help to connect front-end with metamerse.

solidity-> this language is used for smart contract ,etheriun is withdraw or deposit by this code. [etherium Blockchain]

Web 3.0 ->In a Web3 world, information is stored in virtual digital wallets, not in data centers. Individuals use these wallets to tap into Web3 applications, which are run on blockchain technology

JSON -> javaScript Object Notation is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications 

Web3 , Html , javascript , node js and solidity .
